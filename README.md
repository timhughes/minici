# minici

A simple file watcher and test runner for continuous integration during local development.

## Description

`minici` is a lightweight bash script that monitors your project directory for file changes and automatically executes commands (like running tests) whenever changes are detected. It's designed to provide continuous feedback during development by automatically running your test suite or build process when you save files.

## Features

- 🔍 Watches for file changes using `inotifywait`
- 🚀 Automatically runs specified commands on file save
- 🎯 Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- 📝 Filters out temporary files and common build artifacts
- 🧹 Clears screen between runs for clean output
- ⏱️ Debounces rapid file changes to avoid duplicate runs

## Requirements

- `bash`
- `inotify-tools` (provides `inotifywait`)

### Installing inotify-tools

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
```

**Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**
```bash
sudo yum install inotify-tools
```

**Amazon Linux 2:**
```bash
sudo yum install https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/i/inotify-tools-3.14-9.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install inotify-tools
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download the `minici` script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timhughes/minici/main/minici
chmod +x minici
```

2. Optionally, move it to your PATH:
```bash
sudo mv minici /usr/local/bin/
```

Or keep it in your project directory and run it with `./minici`.

## Usage

Basic syntax:
```bash
./minici <command> [arguments...]
```

### Examples

**Run pytest on file changes:**
```bash
./minici pytest
```

**Run pytest with specific options:**
```bash
./minici pytest -v tests/
```

**Run a custom build script:**
```bash
./minici npm test
```

**Run multiple commands:**
```bash
./minici sh -c "npm run lint && npm test"
```

**Run Python unit tests:**
```bash
./minici python -m unittest discover
```

### How It Works

1. `minici` starts monitoring the current directory (recursively)
2. When a file is saved (`close_write` event), it checks:
   - Is the event recent? (within 1 second to debounce)
   - Is the file not in `.git` directory?
   - Is the file not ignored by `.gitignore`?
   - Does the file not match common temporary file patterns?
3. If all checks pass, it clears the screen and runs your command
4. The output is displayed, and monitoring continues

### Excluded Files

The following patterns are automatically excluded from triggering runs:
- Hidden editor files (`.*.swp`, `.*.swx`)
- Git lock files
- Build directories
- Log files
- pytest cache
- Coverage files
- And more (see `EXCLUDE_REGEX` in the script)

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior by editing the script variables:

- `STALE_EVENT_SECS`: Time window for debouncing events (default: 1 second)
- `EXCLUDE_REGEX`: Pattern for files to ignore
